<h1 id='description'>Note Taker <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><img alt="The MIT License" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg" /></a></h1><br />Note Taker is a privately hosted website that allows a user to take down any notes they like in plain text format. It works by writing new notes into the server's JSON database so that the user may access all of their notes whenever they want to. The site also features functionality to allow the user to delete any of their stored notes for when they don't need them anymore.<br /><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=https://github.com/Shrcker/Note-Taker>Github Link</a><br /><img src="./images/note-taker-screen.png" alt="Project Screenshot" /><br /><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ol><li><a href="#description"><span>Description</span></a></li><li><a href="#usage"><span>Usage</span></a></li><li><a href="#credits"><span>Credits</span></a></li><li><a href="#license"><span>License</span></a></li><li><a href="#questions"><span>Questions</span></a></li><li><a href="#features"><span>Features</span></a></li></ol><br /><h2 id='usage'> Usage</h2><br /> Either follow this <a href="https://tanias-note-taker-df5cd56a8d5d.herokuapp.com/"><span>Link</span></a>, or download the source code and host on your own localhost server.<br /><h2 id='credits'> Credits</h2><br /> Thanks goes to the EdX Bootcamp Program for providing the source code of this project.
